## Getting started

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Running and developing this website requires an up-to-date Node.js version. You
can check what Node.js version you have currently installed with

```bash
node -v
```

Please refer to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if
you don't have it installed or if your installed version is older than 16.

#### Vue CLI

Ensure that you have the Vue CLI installed with

```bash
vue -V
```

Or install it with:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Additional intructions are available on the
[official Vue CLI website](https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started).

## Development

### Accessing the backend

The project requires access to a
[backend service](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-registry-backend) to work. The
[development configuration provided](vue.config.js) intercepts the calls to the
backend and forwards them to `0.0.0.0:8085`.

#### Spinning up a development version of the st4sd-registry-backend

To use a local development version of the `st4sd-registry-backend` please follow
the instructions provided at:
https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-registry-backend#developing-locally.

#### Port-forwarding the backend from an OpenShift deployment

Another option is to port-forward the backend from the OpenShift project where
we deployed ST4SD. To access it, **after ensuring we are logged in to the
OpenShift cluster**, we can run the following command:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/st4sd-registry-backend 8085:8085 -n $DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE
```

Where `$DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE` is the namespace where you deployed ST4SD. You can
omit it if you're forwarding the service from the active namespace (you can
check what the active namespace is with `oc project`).

### Installing dependencies

Install the dependencies for this project with:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Build a development version of this project with hot reloading

This command will build a development version of the website (without
optimizations) and start a server where you can preview the changes you've made,
with hot reloading capabilities.

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Build for production

This command will create a production-ready build of the website. It will apply
optimizations such as minifying the output files.

```bash
yarn build
```

### Lint and fix files

To ensure there are no linting errors in the files, run:

```
yarn lint
```

The dev configuration already includes `prettier`, which will help during
development, giving errors in case of missing `;`, wrong indentation, etc. These
errors can often be fixed automatically in IDEs such as Visual Studio Code using
the "Format Document" key binding (`notebook.formatCell`, Option+Shift+F on
MacOS).
